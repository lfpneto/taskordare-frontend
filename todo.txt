group-controller:
- when a group is created, also add the user who created to the user_group table and set him as admin
- get all members from a group
- kick a member from a group if the one who kicking is admin (i will also hide the icon to kick if he is not admin but double verification is better)
- set a member admin
- remove a member from admin
- invite someone to join a group (new table?) or just brute force add him by his email
- way to join a group by a secret code (new column on the group table)

tasks-controller
- get all tasks from a group
- create a new task in a group
- get all tasks from a user
- update a task (not available to update points)

dares-controller
- create a dare
- update a dare (not available to update points)
- delete dare
dares right now dont have points because the points are associated with the user to the group, so either we associate dares again to the groups or create a reward column in the dares as type string just to at least have some logic in this, dares right now have no challenger and no accepenter player
